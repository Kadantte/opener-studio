							As you might have noticed lately, Opener Studio is
							not very stable.
						</p>
						<p className={tw`m-0`}>
							In fact, a lot of nHentai client is not functioning
							properly.
							<br />
							Tachiyomi, and many client is not functioning
							<br />
							NClientV2 is working but slow.
						</p>
						<p className={tw`m-0`}>
							This happened from nHentai is now using Cloudflare
							to increase Security for months.
							<br />
							Leading to global API failure but we can't blame
							them for that.
						</p>
						<p className={tw`m-0`}>
							Opener is also one service that is using nHentai
							too,
							<br />
							so we suffered the same condition as everyone else.
						</p>
						<p className={tw`my-0`}>
							Opener will be shutdown at 20 July 2022.
						</p>
						<p className={tw`my-4 text-lg font-bold`}>
							But we are not letting that, stopping us here.
						</p>
						<p className={tw`m-0`}>
							Opener is created for everyone could have a better
							experience reading Hentai.
							<br />
							From I, single developer, volenteerly without any
							gains or profits.
						</p>
						<p className={tw`m-0`}>
							Since the creation of Opener, I've gained absolutely
							0 penny.
							<br />
							Opener gains no profits, only here to make the
							experience of reading Hentai better.
						</p>
						<p className={tw`mt-4 mb-0 text-lg font-bold`}>
							And I don't want to make that vision stop here.
						</p>
						<p className={tw`mb-4 mt-0 text-lg font-bold`}>
							That's why I'm rebranding Opener to{' '}
							<a

								Hifumin
							</a>
						</p>
						<p className={tw`my-0`}>
							From the experience of working on Opener.
							<br />
							Hifumin is entirely re-engineered from the ground
							up.
						</p>
						<p className={tw`my-0`}>
							Hifumin is not a clone of Opener, but an entirely
							different level of product.
						</p>
						<p className={tw`my-0`}>
							It extends vision of Opener, making it more
							accessible.
							<br />
							But the ultimate goal is to push technology to the
							absolute limits.
						</p>
						<p className={tw`my-0`}>
							Hifumin is a collection of services, all working
							together to create one simple product.
						</p>
						<p className={tw`mt-4 mb-0 text-lg font-bold`}>
							The world fastest, most consistant Hentai reader.
						</p>
						<p className={tw`my-0`}>
							Even if nHentai is down, Hifumin will still be
							working.
							<br />
							Making it truly globally accessible.
						</p>
						<p className={tw`my-0`}>
							I whole heartly thank you all for using Opener.
							<br />
							And I want to invite you to see the new chapter of
							our platform, together.
